  title: From Tools to Adoption
  subtitle: 'A Path to Modular and Interactive Scientific Publishing'
  description: |
    Scientific content remains trapped in static formats that limit reuse, attribution, and machine readability, despite the availability of modern tooling that makes this possible and better matches how scientists conduct research. This workshop, led by openRxiv and Continuous Science Foundation, addresses this challenge through practical implementation rather than consensus-driven standardization.
