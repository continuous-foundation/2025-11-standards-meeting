  title: From Tools to Adoption
  subtitle: 'A Path to Modular and Interactive Scientific Publishing'
  description: |
    From tools to adoption: A working meeting charting a path to modular and interactive scientific publishing. November 6-8th a group of 25 open-science leaders gathered in San Diego for an in-person implementation workshop to unify modular scientific publishing tools around shared reference implementations. The meeting, hosted by openRxiv and Continuous Science Foundation convened developers of leading modular publishing tools and licensing to create a working, federated reference architecture using real content, connected authoring tools, and worked towards shared standards. Our goal was to resolve technical gaps, demonstrate live interoperability, and lay the foundation for modular, machine-readable research publishing.
